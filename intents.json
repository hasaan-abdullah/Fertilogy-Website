Lifestyle changes include adopting a balanced diet with low sugar intake and high fiber to help manage insulin levels and support weight loss, and engaging in regular physical activity to improve insulin sensitivity and assist with weight management, which can reduce PCOS symptoms. Medications such as hormonal birth control (pills, patches, or vaginal rings) can help regulate menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and manage symptoms like acne and excess hair growth. Metformin, often used for type 2 diabetes, can improve insulin sensitivity and help with weight loss and ovulation. Clomiphene is a fertility medication that can stimulate ovulation in women with PCOS who are trying to conceive. Managing symptoms may also involve hair removal treatments like electrolysis or laser hair removal to manage excess hair growth, acne treatments (topical treatments, oral medications, or hormonal treatments) to control acne, and mental health support through counseling or therapy to manage stress, anxiety, or depression associated with PCOS.
